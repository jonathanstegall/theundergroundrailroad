    <div id="content"> <h1>Melanie's Underground Railroad Roadtrip - 1997</h1><p>Wondering about the Underground Railroad Coalition? Looking to add adventure to your life? Let me personally recommend to you a road trip or train ride.</p>
<p>That's what I did that August. I first heard of the Underground Railroad Coalition at Cornerstone '97. Meeting individuals from various ministries in North America was absolutely energizing. I decided to do more than just listen to people talk at a round table discussion; I went to see them in action.</p>
<p>Traveling alone opened the idea to do a train ride, which was something I've wanted to do for several years. Leaving my base in Minneapolis, Minnesota I headed west to Seattle. I was able to walk the streets that Richard of "Black Friday" spoke of and stayed with Joyanna of "Black Orchid." While there I also visited a pastor friend and other ministries touching needy people in the U District.</p>
<p>From there I took the Greyhound to Vancouver where I was met by Trevor of "Fire Fall" His team let me see first hand how this city is becoming the "Amsterdam" of N. America.</p>
<p>A few days later I'm on a beautiful train ride again, now headed east, to Calgary to visit family of a Source Ministry team member. Next, I caught a plane to Winnipeg to revisit ministries and friends there including Alex and Mark of "The Red Herring Cathedral."</p>
<p>Finally, I was accompanied South back to the Twin Cities. Journey ended, journey begun. There's so many more to visit, and new relationships are beginning. Back in the Twin Cities I operate The Dwelling Coffee House of Source Ministries. It was good to see my kids again.</p>
<p>Taking time to be with each other is the only way that we can truly be effective with this coalition. You just never know when you made need the resources of another ministry to touch the life of someone in need.</p>
