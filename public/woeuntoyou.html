</center>
<p>The Hebrew Scriptures tell us in Isaiah 10:1-3: "Woe unto You that make 
unjust Laws, to those who issue oppressive decrees, to deprive the poor of 
their rights and withhold justice from the oppressed of my people, making 
widows their prey and robbing the fatherless. What will you do on the day 
of reckoning, when disaster comes from afar? To whom will you run for help? 
Where will you leave your riches?" (NIV). These very clear scathing 
diatribes have very harsh words for those who would oppress the poor.</p>

<p>And yet, in the United States of America, this is what is being done routinely 
  every day. Whether laws that unfairly sentence the poor and people of color 
  to long sentences for drug charges simply because they are addicts and cannot 
  afford legal counsel, or laws that unjustly sentence poor youth to the adult 
  system without due process of law. Or, laws that criminalize the homeless because 
  they have no shelter, those in power, in the name of "Law and Order," initiate 
  laws that oppress.</p>

<p>Throughout the country, in many states, ordinances are being instituted that 
  make it illegal to sleep on benches, create zones where the homeless aren't 
  allowed, make it criminal to "loiter", and routinely roust the homeless when 
  they are "eyesore" to the business community. In my own state of Florida, they 
  are talking of "relocation programs" for those homeless who have nowhere to 
  go. In my own city, St. Petersburg, Police under orders from the City Officials 
  and the business community routinely harass, arrest, relocate and destroy property 
  of the homeless. To the point that many homeless have no place that is safe 
  to lay their heads for fear that the Police may come and arrest them and destroy 
  their property. In fact, according to the National Coalition for the Homeless, 
  Florida is the 2nd worst state in the nation in its treatment of the homeless. 
  Unfortunately, Social Service providers in my community are either unwilling 
  or afraid of losing Federal, State, and local money, to speak out. And, those 
  of the religious community are also unwilling to be a prophetic voice on this 
  issue, for fear of losing donors. This is ought not to be.</p>

<p>Jesus said that when we see the homeless, we see him. The Scriptures are 
replete with strong words of judgment to those in power that would oppress 
the poor. Those who legislate and enforce unjust laws must be called to 
task. Prophetic voices must arise to speak out against these "Power 
Brokers" that abuse their powers. We, as people of Faith must unite with 
the powerless, and in fact recognize their real power to bring about 
change in this society. We must unite behind the opposed and the poor in 
their struggle for justice. Our desire to see change and to take action 
must be informed by those in the middle of the struggle. And, we must 
recognize that this is a holy and just struggle.</p>

<p>Why is it that people of the Christian Faith seem so unwilling, at 
times, to stand up to power? Why is it that too often people of Faith, lack 
the moral insight and courage to stand up to injustice? It seems that time 
after time we people of Faith allow History to repeat itself, as the German 
Church did in Nazi Germany during WWII. People of Faith especially need to 
take the high road in light of the sacred texts of our Faith. It is time 
that we a stand and obey God rather than man. How is that so many 
"Christians" can call themselves "Pro-Life" and yet care nothing for the 
plight of the opposed and poor in our inner cities and rural areas. How can 
we not speak up against unjust laws that seek to criminalize the homeless 
simply because they have no place to lay their heads? If we do not take a 
stand on these issues now, then it will be too late when "jack booted 
thugs" come and take us away. The choice is ours. Will we do what is moral 
and just? Our will we just sit by on the sidelines, while the "least of 
these" is taken away? God help us.</p>
