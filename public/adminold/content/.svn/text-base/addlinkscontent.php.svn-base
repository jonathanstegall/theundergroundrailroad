<h2>add links:</h2>
<p>Links will appear on the links page. When adding links, be sure that http:// is at the beginning, as what you add will be used as the link.</p>
<p>If a category does not exist that the particular link should go into, <a href="contactjon.php">contact the webmaster</a> and let him know that the category should be created. Go ahead and send him the link, as well.</p>
