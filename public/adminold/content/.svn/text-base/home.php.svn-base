<p>Welcome to the admin area for The Underground Railroad. Here, you can administer the various areas of content that the site contains. Many things are already operational, and more will become so as the need arises.</p>
<h3>instructions</h3>
<p>Use the navigation links on the left side to reach the various areas that you can edit. Obviously, only the links that work have working functionality.</p>
<p>If there is a specific function you need, send a message through the <a href="contactjon.php" title="contact webmaster">contact webmaster</a> link. That functionality can then be pushed up the priority list, or placed on that list if it is not already there.</p>
<h3>remember...</h3>
<p>Never supply your login information to anyone else. If someone <strong>needs</strong> acess to this administrative area, submit that to the webmaster by contacting him. If it is a legitimate need, a unique login will be created for that person.</p>
<p>In web security, like any security, it is important to keep access limited to those who <strong>need</strong> it. This is not because of a lack of trust, but simply to avoid people making honest mistakes, or leaving open security holes, or anything else that could go wrong. It is to protect everyone involved, so please honor this.</p>
<h4>and always, always log out when you leave</h4>
